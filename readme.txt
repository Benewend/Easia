compile first Tokenizer.cpp and then parser.cpp before 
running compiling all of them with Cal.cpp
exemple for g++:
	first->g++ Tokenizer.cpp -c
	secondly->g++ parser.cpp -c
	finally -> g++ Tokenizer.o parser.o Cal.cpp -o easia 


thanks for testing easia and talking about it ... look for the repository of easia on github
