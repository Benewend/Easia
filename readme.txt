All the information about our programming language named Easia The users: 
  -Newbies, intro to programming 
  students and their teachers The purpose of the language: -Be an easy language for beginners and for intro
  to programming students -Be an easy tool for the teachers that’s giving the intro to programming class

  Brain storm about the easy concept: -The usual functions must be at easy as possible for the users ex: printing…
  -Dynamic typing -no curly braces -The whole source file should be contained in one Variables naming rules: The 
  name of a variable can only start with a letter (capital or not) or an underscore and should be written in one 
  word. Shouldn't be one of the following key-word. Can contain numbers
