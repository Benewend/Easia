#sample of code in easia 
a<-0
#printing the values from 1 to 10
as long as a<10:#this the equivalent of while in c like languagues 
	a<-a+1
	show(a)
#printing the even number from 0 to 100 whithout conditional statement
for va going from 0 to 100 by 2:
		show(va)
#printig a start triangle 
for i going from 0 to 30:
	a<-"*"*i
	show(a)

#the show function takes no other argument than a variable thus in 
#order to print something you need to assign it's value to a variable before 
#using it
